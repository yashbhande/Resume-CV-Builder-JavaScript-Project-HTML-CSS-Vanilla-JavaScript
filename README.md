# Resume-CV-Builder-JavaScript-Project-HTML-CSS-Vanilla-JavaScript

Hey Yash here :)
This project involves building a Resume/CV Builder using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive and visually appealing platform for designing resumes or CVs.

The project begins by setting up the development environment and establishing the basic HTML structure for the Resume/CV Builder. The layout of the resume includes sections for personal information, education, work experience, skills, and more.

CSS is utilized to style the resume and achieve a professional and eye-catching design. Techniques such as color application, font selection, and responsive design will be covered to ensure that the resume appears visually appealing on various devices and screen sizes.

JavaScript is incorporated to add interactivity and functionality to the Resume/CV Builder. Through JavaScript, you will learn how to dynamically update the resume content based on user input. This includes the ability to add or remove sections, update personal information, and highlight different skills and experiences.

The project also incorporates form validation features to ensure that users provide accurate and valid information when creating their resumes. Additionally, you will explore methods to generate downloadable PDF versions of the resumes using JavaScript libraries or APIs.

By the end of the project, you will have a fully functional Resume/CV Builder that empowers users to easily create and customize their resumes. The skills acquired throughout this project will enable you to further enhance and customize the project according to your unique design preferences and specific requirements.

Feel free to personalize and expand upon this project to make it your own. It can serve as a valuable tool for crafting professional resumes and showcasing your qualifications to potential employers.
